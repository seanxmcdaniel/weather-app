My application is not finished yet because I've been having a lot of trouble with the server-side APIs aspect of JavaScript. The application is not functional yet but when I'm finished with it, the searched cities will be saved into local storage and appear on the page as list items in the column to the left underneath the search input. In the large column on the right side, the current weather will show for the searched city. Underneath the current weather will be 5 different cards that show the 5-day forecast. I will resubmit when I finish this challenge.
